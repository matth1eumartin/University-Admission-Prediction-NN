# University-Admission-Prediction-NN

## Description
In this project, I developed a Neural Network using TensorFlow and Sci-Kit Learn to predict how likely it was that a student would be admitted to college in the US based on their scores in a variety of tests and the ranking of the College to which they were applying. This project was mostly about analyzing and learning about the different ways that a neural network can be optimized, and looking at the mean average error (MAE) of different methods.
